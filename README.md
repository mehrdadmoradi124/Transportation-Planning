# Transportation-Planning
“Transportation Planning” course project; Implementing a research paper entitled “Using data mining techniques for bike sharing demand prediction in metropolitan city” into python code and improving the results, Fall 2020.

This was a research project for Transportation Planning course. In this project, we read this paper carefully. (https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/Transportation-Planning/blob/main/Paper.pdf)
They tried to predict bike sharing demand in Seoul city using a data set. They coded this in R and our goal was to code this in Python and improve the results.
We did all the things that paper did such as data pre processing and applying different models. Then we added two more data sets about weather and air polution.
We found them online using online weather websites. This new information alongside trying other models that paper didn't try, improved the results.
